Cloud Based Team Collaboration Tool that you need

Streamlining internal communication with your team, external client engagement and general task management needs a robust collaboration software which can reduce the logistics of communication and team collaboration. 

A Cloud based team collaboration software should make simple to share files, check updates and manage email communication between team members in any organization. Teams should be able to work together with and access each other’s uploaded files in the same workspace. 

Online Collaboration tools improve productivity

Cloud based collaboration tools have managed to resolve one of the biggest challenges to document sharing. As it often happened in the recent past, sharing files via emails was not really sharing at all. More often than not, it led to the confusion of different versions of the same file being created, which in turn increased redundancies. Errors increases as well as time that was spent on a particular project, as often team members would spend hours working on a outdated version of the file, thereby increasing the workload. 

An online collaboration tool is expected to make document sharing, email communications and sending and receiving instructions a whole lot easier and stress free. Although there is need for cloud based team collaboration software, in the market, it is important to note that all kinds of software are not easily acceptable in the organizations. 

An online collaboration tool has to be - 

- User friendly. It should not be stuffy and complicated and the user interface should be as easy as your regular chat box. 

- Secure. Security is a major concern as organisations do not want to use any cloud based collaboration tool, if the documents are sensitive in nature. 

- Compact - Imagine if you are promised a tool that would replace all your other tools that are used for emails, document sharing, communicating, etc., but it takes up a lot of memory space. It would not be conducive for everyone to use. The online team collaboration software has to be compact, which can run in any device and use any connection.
