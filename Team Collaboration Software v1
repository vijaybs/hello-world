Online Collaboration Tools
The success of a project many times hinges on a team’s ability to collaboration efficiently and with minimal miscommunications and obstructions. Providing a platform that allows for transparent communication is a necessity in any organization. Allow your employees to focus their efforts by removing distracting emails, as well as streamline scattered communication through Power Messaging™. Bring your internal and external communications together in one platform and collaborate with your team from anywhere in the world and securely from any device.

Cloud Based Team Collaboration Tool that you need
In order to truly streamline your team communication (internal, external, and task management), you need a constantly accessible and easy to use collaboration software so that teams can manage tasks, projects, and conversations around the clock.
A Cloud based team collaboration software should simplify file sharing, deliver notifications, alerts and updates and manage communication between team members in any organization. Teams should be able to work together in a shared workspace from anywhere.
Online Collaboration tools improve productivity
Cloud based collaboration tools have managed to make file sharing simpler and easier than ever. Now across any distances, one can instantly share any piece of content with anyone else, digitally. However, many email and messaging solutions only offer the ability to send and view documents, but do not provide the ability to affect the documents either by visual annotations, audio annotations, text comments, or a combinations. Allowing team members to collaborate on documents virtually, the way people have only been able to do physically in person.
An online collaboration tool is expected to make document sharing, email communications and sending and receiving instructions much simpler and stress free as a whole. Although there is a need for cloud based team collaboration software, in the market, it is important to note that not all software is easy to adopt inside of an organization.
An online collaboration tool has to be -
User friendly. It should not be bulky and complicated and the user interface should be as easy as your regular chat box or messaging app.
Secure. Security is a major concern as organisations do not want to use any cloud based collaboration tool, if the documents are sensitive in nature.
Cross Platform. Your team must be able to access their colleagues and content from any device by using their secure account. Being able to do your work from behind a desk on the computer, on their phone on their commute, or on their tablet from their living room, is paramount for the modern worker to be able to effectively and efficiently work. By not being confined to a device, or set of devices, your team can have the freedom to work when and where they want.
Moxtra is the next generation mobile-first, team collaboration software on the cloud. It allows you to send instant messages, share files, arrange virtual meetings with your team, share your screen, and host and join full-featured live web conferences from any device.
Task and Workflow Management by Moxtra Communication App
Currently, when a colleague emails a document or file over for review, it must be taken out of email and edited and annotated in another application, or applications, only to be re-uploaded and commented on in the email thread. Moxtra’s workflow allows for revisions, comments, annotations and iterations to all take place right within the Moxtra Binder, your team’s shared project-based workspaces. You could just highlight the changes, share the document in a platform where you and your teammate can view the document at the same time. And you can chat and finish giving your instructions with clarity. This kind of team collaboration has the ability to save valuable time.
Moxtra’s mobile first embeddable communication app has to ability to reduce your time spent collaborating and communicating with your team down by 50%. The Moxtra communication app allows you to create different groups of conversation with different teams for different projects. You can chat with your team, upload files, share pages, create a to-do task list, and integrate various helpful tools, for example, your Google Drive.
